<h1 align="center">JGAT-MAPPO with PPFP: An implementation in RouterRL</h1>
<p align="center"><b>Data Science Center / School of Artificial Intelligence / Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</b></p>

This repository contains the implementation of **JGAT-MAPPO with PPFP**, developed based on the [RouterRL](https://github.com/lgc0208/RouterRL) framework.  
All source code is organized strictly following the **RouterRL standard extension format** for seamless integration.

### Features
- **JGAT-MAPPO**: A novel multi-agent DRL algorithm with Graph Attention Networks for joint routing optimization.
- **PPFP**: Probabilistic Packet Forwarding Protocol ensuring safety.
- Fully compatible with RouterRL's compilation and execution pipeline.

### Integration Instructions
1. **Obtain RouterRL**  
   Clone or download the official [RouterRL](https://github.com/lgc0208/RouterRL) repository.

2. **Copy Files**  
   Follow the RouterRL standard extension format:
   - Place each file from this repository into its corresponding folder in RouterRL.
   - Preserve the directory structure.

3. **Compile & Update**  
   After copying the files into RouterRL, recompile and update the framework to include the JGAT-MAPPO + PPFP extension.

4. **Run**  
   Use the RouterRL CLI or configuration files to run experiments with the `JGAT-MAPPO` algorithm and `PPFP` protocol.
